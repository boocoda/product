# Boocoda Product

This repository act as a support to share and communicate with the internal product team of Boocoda via [public product discussions](https://github.com/boocoda/product/discussions).

These discussions are where you can share suggestions for how the products should be improved and discuss those improvements with the community, including members of the Boocoda product team. Check out [Making Product Suggestions](#making-product-suggestions) to learn how to provide feedback. 

Please review the [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/boocoda/product/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before participating in discussions.

# Making Product Suggestions

We encourage you to [open a discussion](https://github.com/boocoda/product/discussions/categories/feedback-feature-proposal) if you have suggestions for how we can improve our product. You don’t need to have a solution to the problem you are facing to kick off a discussion.

Before making a new discussion, please take a look at previous discussions to see if someone else has already brought to our attention your suggestions. If you find a similar discussion, reply with additional details or react to signal your support rather than creating a new discussion.

The Boocoda product team loves to know why. Describing why you want something by sharing information about your use-case helps us a lot to foster productive and collaborative conversations.

## From Suggestion To Release

Once you kick off a discussion, the Boocoda product team will evaluate the feedback but will not be able to respond to every submission. From there, we will work with you and the entire community to ensure we understand the current capabilities Boocoda doesn’t have and explore the space for potential solutions to your problem statement:

- If the product team determines that we are going to solve the problem you’ve identified, we will keep you informed on the related product discussions.
- If the product team determines that we will not be working to solve the problem you have identified, we may comment on the discussion describing our reasoning so our decisions can remain transparent.
